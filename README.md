# Introduction to LiaScript

LiaScript is an open-source programming language designed for creating interactive online courses and tutorials. It allows authors to write instructional material in a simple text format, which can be easily converted into a variety of web-based formats, including HTML, Markdown, and LaTeX.

One of the key features of LiaScript is its ability to embed interactive elements directly into the course material. For example, authors can include quizzes, coding exercises, and interactive visualizations, which learners can interact with directly on the page. This helps to make the learning experience more engaging and effective.

LiaScript also includes support for a range of programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and R, allowing authors to include code examples and demonstrations in their courses.

Overall, LiaScript is a powerful tool for creating engaging and interactive online courses and tutorials, and is well-suited for use in educational settings.

## Writing your course

### Adding lists

1. Ordered lists can be create by simply specifiying a number followed by a (.) before the title of the list.
2. Unordered lists can be created by using the (*) symbol before the title of the list. 

For Example: 

* Unordered List 1
* Unordered List 2

You can also create tables like- 

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| :------- | :------- |
| Item 1   | Item 2   |

The user can sort the elements in the table using the buttons. An example of how this page would look like in markdown is given below.
